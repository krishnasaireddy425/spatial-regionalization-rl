# üó∫Ô∏è Spatial Regionalization using Reinforcement Learning (DQN)

In this project, I explored how to use **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to group parts of a map into regions that are both connected and similar. This is helpful for things like city planning or organizing areas based on population, income, or other data.

## What is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where a model learns by trying things out. It takes an action, gets feedback (like a reward or a penalty), and uses that to improve itself.  
It‚Äôs similar to learning a game by playing it and figuring out what works through trial and error.

Instead of giving the model fixed rules, I used **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** so it could learn the best way to group areas on its own by interacting with the data.

## What is DQN (Deep Q-Network)?

DQN is a type of reinforcement learning that uses a neural network to help the model make better decisions.  
Instead of storing all possible actions and outcomes, it uses deep learning to estimate which action is likely to give the best result.

## What I Built

- Used a real-world dataset that was also used in past research  
- Built and trained a DQN model using **Python** and **TensorFlow**  
- Created a reward system to help the model understand what good grouping looks like  
- Compared my model‚Äôs performance with a traditional method called **Region2Vec**  
- Visualized the results to show how the model improved over time

## Final Thoughts

I really enjoyed working on this project because it let me solve a real-world problem and explain the process in a way that's easy to follow.  
It helped me improve both my technical skills and my ability to communicate clearly‚Äîsomething I care a lot about.
